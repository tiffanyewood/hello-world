% in place of / is a "mod" operator (modulo) that returns ONLY the remainder from a division problem. This can be used to determine if a result in code is odd or even based on if it returns a 1 or 0.

Floating point accuracy and representation errors - 0.1 can not be exactly represented as a binary fraction, so instead the closest number is the output. Example = 1/3 = .3 or .33 or .333333333333333333 indefinitely, so in reality none of those outputs are "accurate", they are just close.
